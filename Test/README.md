# The steps for reproducing testing

## Trained models
We first provide 33 trained models to facilitate reproducing. The 33 trained models are obtained according to the provided training codes in training parts by ourselves. The 33 trained models are stored in 11 folders seperately, and you can download them from [**here**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xVIJdwCDbxVTjmlzo7YXUmlc8JwTUUgA?usp=sharing).

There is a one-to-one relation between the name of training datasets and the name of folders that stores trained models. 

| Training datasets  | Folders storing models |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| isc_100k_256_big_bw  | V5_baseline_BW  |
| isc_100k_256_big | V5_baseline_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_blur_bw  | V5_blur_BW  |
| isc_100k_256_big_blur  | V5_blur_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_color_p4_bw  | V5_color_BW  |
| isc_100k_256_big_color_p4 | V5_color_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_dark | V5_dark_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_ff_bw | V5_face_BW  |
| isc_100k_256_big_ff| V5_face_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_opa | V5_opa_CC  |
| isc_100k_256_big_u | V5_u_CC  |

These 11 folders are also given in the test part. You should download the trained models by yourselves and store them into the according folders seperately.
